# Pathfinding Visualization with Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project visualizes the pathfinding process using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The user can interact with the grid to set obstacles, start, and end points, and visualize the shortest path between the start and end points.

## Group Members

- Bassam Naeem
- Saria Ahmed
- Bilal Hussain

## Features

- Interactive grid where users can toggle obstacles.
- Set start and end points by double-clicking on the grid cells.
- Visualize the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Animated pathfinding process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bassamnaeem/pathfinding-visualization.git
   cd pathfinding-visualization
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Click on the grid cells to toggle obstacles.
2. Double-click on a cell to set the start (blue) or end (red) point.
3. Click the "Find Path" button to visualize the shortest path (green).
4. Use the "Clear Path" button to clear the current path.
5. Use the "Reset Grid" button to reset the grid to its initial state.
